# EvaluateMuscleTissueWithElastography
App that enables the automatic evaluation of muscle tissue on elastography imaging using MATLAB.
With this tool it is possible to evaluate clips of muscle tissue extracted from the Aixplorer devices without a research package automatically. You will receive the parameters of each single frame within the clip in a spread sheet. Further details can be found in our manuscript which is currently under review. Thus, we unfortunately cannot publish the manuscript here yet.

Please see the short guide for further explanations of the GUI.

update: Plase see the corrected version "Version 2", where we corrected some bugs and included hints given by the reviewers. @ the Reviewers: Thank you very much again for your valuable comments and your effort reviewing this code!
